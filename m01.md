# 1.1 The Advent of Decentralized Ledger Technology

| Year | Era | Medium | Advantage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Pre-1970 | Analog Era | Paper Documentation | x |
| 1970 | Digital Era | Mainframe & Computers | Speed |
| 2000 | Internet Era | Interconnected computers | Speed, Access & Collaboration |
| 2009 | Trust Era | Public blockchain & distributed ledgers | Speed, Access & Collaboration, Trust |

| Centralised Ledger | Distributed Ledger |
| ---- | ----|
| Single authority verifies, records, and executes transactions | Entire network records and validates each transaction |

Thus Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) are key component of Web 3.0.

DLTs limitations (especially layer one blockchain-based technologies have inherent weakeness that pose challenges to mass adoption)
- enormous amount of energy required
  - to run consensus algorithm across network
- low processing speed
  - due to overhead of consensus algorithm
- high unpredictable processing cost
  - due to number of transactions and price of tokens vary throughout the year
- security vulnerabilities
  - needs a robust consensus algorithm to prevent node from taking over or harming network
- centralisaation and transparency concerns
  - require good governance model to make network transparent and auditable

Blockchain History
- It is important to review the people who inhabit Yap Island and their unique currency called Rai Stones
- These stones could not be physically traded so the Yapese people used mental ledgers where all tribe members kept a copy of the ledger in their head
- First known use of a ledger

Byzantine Generals Problem
- The problem: Number of general (from same army) have surrounded a walled city on all sides
- Balance of power is such that if all generals attack at the same time, they will take the city
- The challenge: If general are not coordinated in their attack, they will lose the city and their campaign
- The solution: Use cryptography to encrypt messages
- Provides mathematical computation power
- Ensures privacy
- In 2008, a whitepaper is published by Satoshi Nakamoto which outlines a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem
- Bitcoin was started and thus the cryptocurrency launched in 2009

History
- Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algo
- Work must be provided to solve the problem
- Bitcoin was the original solution to the BFT problem

Blockchain Release Date
- 2009: Bitcoin
- 2015: Ethereum
- 2015: Hyperledger

# 2.2 What is a Blockchain

Blockchain Basics
- Cryptographically secure, shared, distributed ledger
- Immutable transactions are written on this distributed ledger on distributed nodes
- Transformational technology in which business and government invest in
- It's a decentralised database which stores information in the form of transactions
- Blockchains are similar to a book that can be written to but not erased
   - Book = Blockchain
   - Page = Block
   - Page Entry = Blockchain Transaction
- Blockchains can be private or public
- Blockchains are a revolutionary way of implementing trust into a platform
- Blockchain is a globally shared data structure, transactional backend database (In Bitcoin, it's generally called a ledger)
   - Everyone can read entries in the database just by participating in the network
   - To change something in the database, you have to create a so-called transaction which has to be accepted by all other
   - Transaction implies that the change you want to make (assume you want to change two values at the same time) is either not done at all or completely applied
- Compare blockchain to other technology
   - Telcom network to a telephone
   - Databases are centralised where the blockchain is decentralised
   - Blockchains are not built from a new technology. They are built from a unique syncing of three existing technologies
		
Blockchain Technologies
- P2P networks
- Private Key Encryption
- Programs

Blockchain Digital Identity
- Digital Identity is established
   - Combining a public and private key creates a strong digital identity reference based on possession
	
Blockchain Revolution
- Blockchain is revolutionary in several ways
   - Blockchain is not a new technology but a synching of technologies that now make sense
   - Trust is at the center and essentially removes intermediaries (efficiency)
   - Tamperproof public ledger of value
   - Disruptive to the status quo. Legacy is out
   - Platform with numerous use cases

Blockchain Review
- Blockchain is a complex technology but is a simple concept really. Trust is at the center
   - Blockchains are ledgers shared among computers around the world
   - The ledgers in a blockchain are immutable

# 2.3 Blockchain Ledgers

Blockchain Ledgers
-  Consensus is when the distributed ledger has been updated and all nodes maintain their own identical copy of the ledger
-  This architecture allows for a new capacity as a system of recordkeeping that goes beyond being a simple database
-  A ledger is an append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold more general information than financial records
-  A distributed ledger is a database that stored and updated independently by each node in the blockchain
  - Decentralised and distributed nature is what makes it unique
  - In blockchain, they are immutable
  - Every single node on the network processes every transaction that occurs

# 2.4 Blockchain Components

Blockchain Key Components
-  Cryptography
-  P2P Network
-  Shared Digital Ledger
-  Consensus Algorithm
-  Validity Rules
-  Virtual Machines

Cryptography
-  Cryptography for transactions
-  Recorded, encrypted and secured between peers in blockchain
-  No need for a centralised authority
	
P2P Network
-  P2P Network connects the blockchain nodes
-  All computers share responsibility on the network
-  Workloads are shared

Shared Digital Ledger
-  Shared Digital Ledger is a data structure managed inside the node application
-  Distributed Database held and updated independently by each participant (or node) in a large network

The Consensus Algorithm
-  The Consensus algorithm is implemented as part of the node application for how the ecosystem comes to a single view of the ledger
-  Different ecosystems have different methods for attaining consensus
-  Determines method for world state (view of the blockchain and its status)

Validity Rules
-  Validity Rules (validation) state how the user and the transactions will be validated

Virtual Machine
-  Virtual Machines are a representation of a server created by a computer program and operated with instructions embodied in a language
-  Ethereum and Bitcoin uses VMS
-  E.g., The virtual machine lives in the Ethereum node applications

# 2.5 Blockchain Permission (Private) or Permissionless (Public)

Blockchain Architectures
- Originally developed as permissionless (E.g., BTC)
- Public Blockchain, Open Blockchain, Permissionless
- Private Blockchain, Closed Blockchain, Permissioned, Enterprise Blockchain
- Ethereum is Permissionless, Hyperledger is Permissioned
- Enterprise prefer Private for security and performance

![img](img/2.5_01.png)

Considerations on private vs public blockchain
- Governance (Generally preferred private blockchain)
- Industry Vertical (Financial logistics -> Private BC, Social Media -> Public BC such as Ethereum)
- Smart Contract Functionality (Private BC such as Hyperledger has flexibility with smart contract unlike ripple. Public BC such as Ethereum is more suitable.
- Cryptocurrency Requirement
- Consensus Algorithm
- Costing Model (Private more expensive as supporting own nodes)
- Integration (BC to an enterprise application, Application Support, Developer integration)
- Transaction Performance
- Trust
- Transparency
- Privacy
- Security

# 2.6 Blockchain Considerations

| | Ethereum | Hyperledger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industry | Cross-Industry | Cross-Industry |
| Ledger | Permissionless | Permissioned |
| Consensus | POW | Pluggable Architecture |
| Smart Contracts | Yes | Yes |
| Coin/Token | Yes | No |

- Understand the industry that the blockchain is going to serve. 
  - Ethereum and Hyperledger are both considered to be cross-industry blockchains 
  - Ripple (more focused on financial industry) 
- Cross-industry 
  - Able to integrate it with your specific enterprise vertical 
    - Hyperledger can be used for EDI or logistics 
- Ledger 
  - Ethereum is for open blockchain approach 
  - Hyperledger is for enterprise 
- Consensus 
  - How it affects performance 
- Smart Contracts 
  - Does your blockchain support smart contract 
- Coin/Token 
  - Ethereum has native cryptocurrency such as Ether 
  - Hyperledger has no native cryptocurrency or token 

# 2.7 Trust or Trustless Blockchain 

Trust Blockchain 
- Establishing Trust In Blockchain 
  - Essentially transferring trust from an intermediary to technology  
  - Storing data in blockchain through cryptography functions 
  - All transaction data on the BC is assumed to be trustworthy 
  - Data has not been tampered with 
  - Blockchain is immutable (can't be deleted or modified) 

Trustless Blockchain 
- What is trustless in Blockchain 
  - Trustless as it is a model that does not require trust to safely interact and transact a deed or purchase 
  - Trustless blockchain is a transfer of trust to technology from organizations (Banks, Government, Corporations) 
  - Built on premise that "transparent code" essentially removes the need for intermediaries (technology) 
  - Smart contracts essentially reduce the need for accountants, lawyers, bankers etc as trust is formed. 
  - Financial transparency can result through the use of blockchains and thus reduce the need for intermediaries 
  - Ledger act as a trust broker when two parties don't trust each other 

# 2.8 Blockchain Forks and Segwits 

Forks 
- Fork is a change to the software of the digital currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history (One Dominant) 
- Can be permanent or temporary 
- Snapshot date where a snapshot of the ledger is captured 
- The snapshot happens at a block number and a new currency is a result (Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Litecoin Cash) 

Hard Fork (Major Upgrade) 
- A hard fork describe a major change to the blockchain protocol which makes previously blocks invalid or transactions valid. 
- Can be used to keep the same coin with major changes to the blockchain or to create a new coin 
- Requires all nodes to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software if they want to use the new coin or blockchain 

Soft Fork (Minor Upgrade) 
- A change that is backward compatible. Instead of 1MB blocks, new rule might only allow 500k blocks 
- A small feature or a capability that has essentially change 
- A change to the software protocol where only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid 
- Soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network 

Soft Fork vs Hard Fork
| Soft Fork | Hard Fork |
| --- | --- |
| Tightening the rules (E.g., 1MB -> 0.5MB) | Expanding the rules (E.g., 1MB -> 2MB) |
| Backwards compatible | Not backwards compatible |
| Old nodes accept new blocks | Old nodes don't accept new blocks |

Hard Fork Examples 
- Ethereum Classic is a split from an existing cryptocurrency Ethereum after a hard fork. 
- Monero is a hard-fork to introduce an upgrade to its network by implementing a feature called Ring Confidential Transactions (RCT) to improve its privacy and security 
- Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork orchestrated by a portion of the community that wanted Bitcoin to scale by increasing its block size from the current 1MB to 8MB 
 
Soft Fork Examples 
- BIP 66: Soft Fork on Bitcoin's signature validation 
- P2SH: Soft Fork that enabled multi-signature addresses in Bitcoin's network 
 
Segwit (Segregated Witness) 
- Separate transaction signatures 
- Removes signatures. 
- Create efficiency of transactions by removing signatures to free up capacity to add more transactions to the chain 
- Increases security threats by removing digital signatures 
- Improves scalability issue (UTX0) 
- Reduces transaction times by skipping calculation for signatures 
- Enables off-chain protocols (P2SH256) 
- Improve transaction security by reducing malleability (ability to be shaped) (transaction malleability) 
 

# 2.9 Comparing Crypto Currency vs Blockchain 

Cryptocurrency 
- Digital currencies are secured using cryptography and combining that with their role as a currency 
- Mined, not printed 
- Considered as digital gold, digital silver 
- E.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Ether, Ripple 
 
Initial Coin Offering 
- An event in which new cryptocurrency sells advance tokens from its overall coinbase in exchange for upfront capital 
- ICOs are frequently used to help developers raise capital

Differences between Cryptocurrency and Blockchain 
- Blockchain is the platform / Blockchain is the enabler 
- Cryptos like Bitcoin uses the blockchain platform / Cryptocurrency uses Blockchain Technology 
- Bitcoin is the first known software (token) for blockchain 
- Platform vs Application 
- BTC is a P2P cryptocurrency that uses the P2P platform (Blockchain) 
- Ethereum is a platform, Ether is the Cryptocurrency 
 
Analogy 
- Blockchain is the train track (Platforms are the enabler) 
- Cryptos are the trains on the track (Applications are enabled)

# 2.10 Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 

Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 
- BIP is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin 
- BIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature 
- Standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure 
- Any developer or anyone from anywhere in the world can propose a BIP 
- Whole Bitcoin community of users, miners, developers and investors to vote on it 
 
Three Major Types of BIPs 
- Standard tracks 
- Informational 
- Process 

Standard Track BIPs 
- Entail making changes to the network protocol, block or transaction validation method 
- It intends to affect the interoperability of the two versions of BIPs or Bitcoin 
- Requires community consensus (E.g., BIP 91) 
 
Informational BIPs 
- Highlight design issues, general guidelines and supporting information 
- E.g., BIP 32 
 
Process BIPs 
- Describe or propose a change in the process 
- Similar to Standard Track BIP and require community consensus 
- E.g., BIP 2 

# 2.11 Cryptocurrency Wallet

Wallet 
- A program which allows you to gain access to send, and receive bitcoins on the blockchain 
- Several types of bitcoin wallets: Hardware, Software, Web 

Software Wallet 
- Programs that you download and run on personal computer 

Web Wallet 
- Hosted on website of a company which provides bitcoin wallet services 
- Wallets are easier to set up and use, but have to rely on hosting company to provide sufficient security measures, which can sometimes be a dangerous trade off  
- Coinbase is an online exchange that is hosted in US 

Hardware Wallet 
- Maintains high levels of security to protect your coins by storing your coins offline 
- Offline storage keeps your coins out of reach from hackers because they are not on the Internet 
- Cost is more expensive than a software or web wallet 
 
Paper Wallet 
- Offline wallet and is considered the safest type 
- Just a printout 
 
Wallet Security 
- Restrict unsupervised accessed. Strong passwords and close all ports and maintain a strict firewall 
- Frequently change address. Use a different address for every transaction 
- Multiple Signatures. Multiple private keys to deter breaches. 
 
Ethereum Wallets 
- E.g., Metamask, Myetherwallet, Jaxx (multi-cryptocurrency wallet) 

# 2.12 Value Creation 

Value Creation of Blockchain Technology 
- Costing 
- Security 
- Privacy 
- Efficiency (Remove Intermediaries) 
- Open source 
 
Value Creation of Blockchain Technology with Tokens 
- Tokens are used as a store of value as entries on a blockchain ledger 
- You own these tokens because you have a key that lets you create a new entry on the ledger, re-assigning the ownership to someone else 
- You don't store tokens on your computer; you store the keys that let you reassign the quantity 
- These are digital resources that you control and can reassign control to someone else 
 
Value Creation of Blockchain Technology with Smart Contracts 
- Smart Contracts is a computer program code that is capable of facilitating, executing, and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement using Blockchain technology 
- Entire process is automated and it can act as a complement or substitute for legal contracts, where the terms of the smart contract are recorded in a computer language as a set of instructions 
- Are not legally enforceable 
- Provide autonomy, trust, backup (immutable), safety, speed, savings (no need for intermediaries), accuracy (removing human factor)
